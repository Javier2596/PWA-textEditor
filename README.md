# Text Editor Starter Code

## Description

This application is a text editor that runs in the browser. The challenge for this application was to satisfy Progressive Web Applications (PWA) criteria. The application also contains many data persistent techniques in case one is not supported by the browser. The application is also meant to function offline. Besides the existing application code, my task was to implement methods for getting and storing data to an IndexedDB database. This application is still in the development process and is not a working application.

## Installation

This app can be installed through the browser for usage offline and online. Once the application is complete it should be able to be opened from the applications icon on the users desktop page and be ready to use. 

## Usage

This application is meant to write snippets of code or notes for coding online or offline.
